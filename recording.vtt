This notebook is very important to me because it holds all my

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.689
notes from starting to work at the Chinese Historical Society of America.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.899
And it's an inspiring notebook because it shows Yuri

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.420
Kochiyama on the front who is an important civil rights activist,

5
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.219
a Japanese American who worked with

6
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.180
Malcolm X and thus

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.969
promoted the idea of solidarity.

8
00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.940
So this notebook is something that helps me keep going every day when I work.
